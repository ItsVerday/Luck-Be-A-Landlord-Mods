## Notes
- All new hexes work with hex-related items, including the Ritual Candle and Holy Water.
- All new hexes interact as expected with Witches and Eldrich Beasts.
- The Hex of Cloning/Hexing/Necromancy and Goat work with the Conveyor Belt item, but *not* the Conveyor Belt essence, due to API limitations.
